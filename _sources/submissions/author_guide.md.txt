# Guide for Authors

Before submitting your project for review with pyOpenSci, make sure that it
adheres to the standards and guidelines put forward in the [authoring guide](../authoring/index).

## Presubmission
If you are unsure if your package fits within pyOpenSci's [scope](../open-source-software-peer-review/aims-and-scope), you're encouraged to open a presubmission inquiry issue on the [software-review](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review) repository.

## Submission for Peer Review
To request peer review, start a new issue in the [pyOpenSci/software-review](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review) repository and fill out the "Submit Software for Review" issue template. For more information on the process and timeline for review, see our [section on the review process](../open-source-software-peer-review/intro).

### JOSS Submission
- If you would like, your package can be submitted to the Journal of Open-Source Software (JOSS) after passing pyOpenSci review. In this case, the package will evaluated by JOSS based on the pyOpenSci review and the paper accompanying your package (see below).
- If you choose to have your package submitted to JOSS after review, it should include a paper.md file describing the package. More detail on JOSSâ€™s requirements can be found at [their website](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#what-should-my-paper-contain).
- **Important note:** Acceptance to pyOpenSci does not guarantee acceptance to JOSS. In particular, JOSS doesn't accept all the types of packages that pyOpenSci does. For example, thin API wrappers fall within pyOpenSci's [scope](../open-source-software-peer-review/aims-and-scope) but are usually not accepted by JOSS. Be sure to review JOSS's [submission requirements](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#submission-requirements) before writing up a paper about your package.
- If you choose this option you should not submit your package to JOSS separately.

## Presubmission Questions

If your package does not clearly fit within one of the categories outlined in our [scope](../open-source-software-peer-review/aims-and-scope), create a [Presubmission Inquiry issue](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/new/choose) in our software-review repo. You can use the same issue template if you have other questions. An editor will get back to you in a few days to answer your questions.

## Package Prep Help

If you would like help preparing your package for review, create a [Help Request issue](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/new/choose) in the software-review repo. We can assign someone to help you prep your code and add things like testing, documentation, and/or continuous integration. We're happy to help. Also check out the rest of our [Packaging Guide](../authoring/overview), which may help answer some of your questions about packaging your code.
