# Guide for Editors

## Editor in Chief

The Editor in Chief serves for 3 months or a time agreed to by all members of the editorial board. The Editor in Chief fulfills the following roles:

- Watches all issues posted to the software-review repo.
- Assigns package submissions to other editors, including self, to handle. For the most part, this position rotates among pyOpenSci editors. However, in some cases, an editor may be assigned if the Editor in Chief thinks someone is particularly well-suited to the contents of a package, or if an editor is not able to support the review process at that time due to time or other conflicts.
- Raises scope/overlap issue with all editors if they see an ambiguous case. This may also be done by handling editors (see below). To initiate discussion, this is posted to the pyOpenSci Slack software review channel, tagging all editors.
- Responds to pre-submission inquiries and `meta` issues posted to the software-review and software-review-meta repos, similarly pinging channel if discussion is needed. Any editor should feel free to step in on these. See [this section](#responding-to-out-of-scope-submissions) about how to respond to out-of-scope (pre-) submissions.
- Responds to referrals from JOSS or other publication partners.
- Monitors the review process pace and reminds other editors to move packages along as needed.

## Editor in Chief Checklist
- Tag issue with `1/editor-checks` tag and assign a main editor.

### Responding to out-of-scope submissions

Thank authors for their submission, explain the reasons for the decision, and direct them to other publication venues if relevant, and to the pyOpenSci governance repo issues for discussion. Use wording from Aims and scope in particular regarding the evolution of scope over time, and the overlap and differences between unconf/staff/software-review development.
